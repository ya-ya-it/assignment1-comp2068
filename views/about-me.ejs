      <p class="about-me">My name is Dasha Davydenko. I am a highly motivated student programmer from Ukraine currently taking Computer Programmer(Co-op) at Georgian College and searching for a work after graduation. I am patient and highly interested in Web and Software Development, love to solve problems and find a working solution. I’m learning extremely fast so even if I don’t know something now, I will learn and implement it quickly, or Google it. I believe there is no problem you can’t find on Google!<br>
      I was working as a Peer Tutor during my third semester in college and I had really great opportunities to improve my learning skills by helping students solve their problems.<br>
      Thank you for taking the time to review my website. If you would like to get in touch to discuss my application and to arrange an interview, you can contact me via <a href="/contact-me">form</a> or by phone at 705-241-1657.</p>
